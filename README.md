# **Predict Income Category: Machine Learning Classification Project**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict an individual's income category based on demographic and financial features. We utilized multiple **Machine Learning classification models**, including **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**, to determine the most effective approach.

## **Key Highlights**
âœ… **Real-world problem-solving:** Predicting income categories has applications in finance, marketing, and social policy.
âœ… **Multiple ML Models:** Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, and LDA.
âœ… **Feature Engineering:** Handled missing data, normalized numerical features, and performed feature selection.
âœ… **Performance Evaluation:** Used metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUROC**.
âœ… **Data Visualization:** Generated insightful plots to analyze feature importance and distribution.
âœ… **Optimization:** Tuned hyperparameters for better model accuracy.

## **Dataset**
- The dataset consists of **demographic and economic attributes**, including age, education level, occupation, work hours per week, and capital gain/loss.
- Preprocessed data to handle missing values and scale numerical features.

## **Models & Performance**
| Model                     | Accuracy | AUROC  |
|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| Baseline (Dummy)          | 76.38%   | 50.00% |
| Logistic Regression (Milestone I) | 85.46%   | 90.87% |
| Tuned Logistic Regression (Milestone III) | 85.45%   | 90.87% |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)   | 84.60%   | 89.84% |
| Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) | 84.68%   | 89.57% |

## **Results & Key Takeaways**
ðŸ“Œ **Best-performing model:** Logistic Regression (Milestone I & III) achieved the highest accuracy and AUROC.
ðŸ“Œ **Feature importance insights:** Logistic Regression showed strong predictive power with well-tuned hyperparameters.
